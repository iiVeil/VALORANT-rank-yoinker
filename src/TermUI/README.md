# TermUI

A UI layer library for python CLI applications built in curses

There is no documentation for this library, if you would like to use it. It is properly documented in docstrings.

If you would like a reference for the library D-Word is built on it. You can find it here: https://github.com/iiVeil/D-Word-Password-Manager

To view a list of avaiable colors, inside the src folder of the library, you can run `colors.py` this file isnt used anywhere else in the library and is purely to view the color pallete
